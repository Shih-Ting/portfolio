                <!-- <h4>Some Background Information</h4>
            <p>In this project, I was given full flexibility to use <i>any technology</i> and UX research method to solve <i>any problem</i>. Due to the difficulties I faced when I first started a long-distance relationship (LDR), I decided to <strong>tackle the sense of intimacy sacrificed because of the distance</strong> with <i>the power of technology.</i></p> -->
                <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
                <h3>Improve Lack of Intimacy Due to Long Distance</h3>
                <p>Being in a long-distance relationship (LDR) can be challenging not only because it's hard to create common goals and memories but also because it can severely wear the romance between partners <b>due to lack of intimacy</b>. Worst yet, the <b>blank between conversations</b> during video-chat can even lead to insecurities in a relationship.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/challenge.jpg" alt="challenge">
                <h6>Long distance can wear away the romance between partners.</h6>
                <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
                <h3>Face Dance Challenge for Couples</h3>
                <p>To improve the sense of intimacy between partners in LDR, I came up with a game extension for Messenger which features a video-chat-based game, somatosensary interaction and a collaboration-based scoring mechanism. Face Dance Challenge is an extension that improves the lack of intimacy between couples at any stage of an LDR by filling up the blank between conversations, transmitting sense of touch, and creating a common goal for partners to achieve.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/FDC_overview.png" alt="overview">
                <h6>Screens of Mobile Interfaces</h6>
                <h4>Research</h4>
                <p> To better understand my design challenge, I conducted a semi-constructed diary study on 3 relationship-related boards on the most popular BBS forum in Taiwan that preserves more than 20 years of records to understand the challenges that LDR couples in different stage of relationship would face.</strong>
                </p>
                <h5>Understanding the Users</h5>
                <p>Based on my findings from the diary study, I built 4 personas, 3 pro-persona and 1 anti-persona, to better target the success of potential users -- most couples that have successfully conquered LDR share common goal in life and what bothers them the most is not having physical interactions.</p>

                <h5>Marketing Research</h5>
                <p>To understand current digital solutions for LDR couples, I selected 5 top-rated applications designed for couples from the App Store. However, current solutions requires extra steps to connect and none of them provides physical interaction.</p>

                <h4>Design Approach</h4>
                <h5>Ideation: Solution Exploration</h5>
                <p>Based on research insights, I sketched out 8 different solutions, ranging from restaurant service design to waterproof remote control vibrator for sexual purposes. These solutions aims to help couples interact as if they were on each other's side.</p>

                <h6>8 Solutions to the Challenge</h6>
                <br>
                <h5>Use Cases and Context (User Journey)</h5>
                <p>To understand how users currently interact with their loved ones, I map out how couples in different stage of a relationship (crush, in a relationship, married) based on the 3 pro-personas.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/user_journey.png" alt="user journey story map">
                <h6>User Journey Map</h6>
                <p>With the user journey map, I concluded 2 things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Couples are connected with their loved ones on social media.</li>
                    <li>Couples would try to improve their interactions when there's a gap in between.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>These findings led me to my final decision on redesigning FDC as a game extension on Messenger.</p>
                <!-- <p>Based on the story map, I concluded that couples also use social media to connect with their loved ones and a lot of uncertainties about the relationship stems from the gaps between interactions. </p> -->
                <!-- Hence, I decided to go with Messenger and iPhone as the foundation of the game as Messenger is the most common way that partners are connected and iPhone screens can detect different degrees  of presses and creates haptic feedback. -->
                <br>
                <h5>Design Synthesis &amp; Rationale</h5>
                <p>Following user journey mapping, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JbCkS40tbirPz-eXj--dZ51ZmK9kenL9/view?usp=sharing">QOC (Questions, Options and Criteria) rationale</a> is implemented to explore the possibilities and challenges of different means of interaction in the video-chat-based game.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/qoc.jpg" alt="qoc">
                <h6>Design Rationale (solid lines: criteria met; dotted lines: against the criteria)</h6>
                <!-- <p>To check the validity of my final solution, I went through <strong>story-mapping to model user activities and their current potential ways of interacting with their couples.</strong> Finally, I <strong>iterate through <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JbCkS40tbirPz-eXj--dZ51ZmK9kenL9/view?usp=sharing">3 rounds of QOCs (Question, Options and Criteria)</a></strong> to explore the potential key features I want to include in my final design as well as how these features will be presented. </p> -->
                <h4>Rapid Prototyping</h4>
                <p>To validate my research ideas and the initial design, I conducted a round of rapid prototyping and came up with 10 interactions to test with users.</p>
                <h5>Paper Prototyping</h5>
                <p>The first iteration is rapid prototyping on paper. My sketches include 2 major themes: 1) Messenger and 2) Face Dance Challenge.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/paper_prototype.png" alt="paper prototypes">
                <h6>Messenger paper prototypes (upper row); Face Dance Challenge prototypes (lower row)</h6>
                <br>
                <h5>User Testing</h5>
                <p>Then I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCPuFhtKV34">tested 2 users</a> with paper prototypes and here are the major takeaways from the test:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's hard for users to find out where the extensions live under Messenger text chat mode.</li>
                    <li>Users only react to the emojis that shows on their half of the screen.</li>
                    <li>When the game ends, users are confused as they were not able to see their partner in the leading board screens, even though they are actually in a video chat.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCPuFhtKV34" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->
                <!-- <h6>Low-fi prototype demonstration</h6>
            <p>With clearer picture of how my final design would be like, I started to work on my low-fi prototypes that <strong>models 10 tasks and 15+ interactions</strong> I would like to test. </p> -->
                <!-- <h4>Design Details</h4>
            <h5>Game Invocation</h5>
            <p>There are 2 ways to invoke FDC in Messenger: 1) tap invocation and 2) tongue invocation, making the FDC more accessible.</p>
            <img src="" alt="game invocation img">
            <h5>Interactive Game</h5>
            <p>Couples would be able to see each other's change of facial expression, talk and laugh with each other and even feel each other via haptic feedback in the game.</p>
            <img src="" alt="interactive game img">
            <h5>Scoring</h5>
            <p>FDC has a cooperation-based scoring mechanism -- Partners aren't competing against their loved ones but other couples.</p>
            <img src="" alt="scoring img">
            <h5>Digital Prototype</h5>
            <p>I've put together a working <a href="https://invis.io/6SERY10CF">prototype</a> in InVision to show the full functionality of how Face Dance Challenge works as a Messenger game extension.</p> -->
                <h4>Major Design Changes</h4>
                <p> With the feedback and takeaways from the user tests, I then move on to hi-fi prototyping and design iterations, with an eye to creating a joyful gaming experince:</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/iteration_1.png" alt="gaming interface">
                
                <!-- <p>In the original design, the emoji would fly into the screen vertically from the bottom side of the screen. Since my user was <strong>confused about how to react when she saw an emoji flying on the other side of the screen,</strong> I decided that emoji would always fly in the middle from the bottom, <i>which sacrifice the level of difficulty but improves the interaction.</i> </p> -->
                <!-- <h4>Iterations</h4>
                <p>From the brainstorming to prototyping, <strong>I’m always thinking about my design.</strong> Whenever I have a new idea in my mind, I always talk to my boyfriend about it and discuss the pros and cons of it. Especially when I’m working on high-fi prototypes, I <strong>come up with new designs every day</strong> and usually spend more than a half of prototyping time to refine the design I made earlier. Generating new ideas every day was hard; however, it turned out that I do have <strong>made a lot of breakthroughs in terms of the visual representation as well as the interactions between screens and users.</strong> For instance, at first, the only way for my users to switch between screens was by tapping on the space on the screen but as I discovered more about InVision, I eventually <i>set timer to switch between screens to make the motion of flying emoji much similar to how it would work in reality. </i></p> -->
                <h4>One Step Further</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/incentives.png" alt="design philosophy">
                <h6>Incentive-increasing features</h6>
                <p>My design philosophy has always been <strong>“People respond to incentives.”</strong> Aside from maintaining consistency across the whole project, I always think one step further as of how to <strong>make my design appealing and attractive in the long run.</strong> Thus, an explicit feature that has to do with incentive-creating is the mechanism that <strong>couples can unlock more interactions as they score more points.</strong> Additionally, I add another line of word hinting the users on how far they are from the new interaction. Other than that, I want to <strong>avoid LDR couples who play FDC to fight because of the game.</strong> Thus, the mechanism of the game itself awards good teamwork but <strong>if only one of the couple performs well, they can still gain points.</strong> Through this scoring mechanism, I would like to convey the message that though it’s perfect that we, as a couple, can work well together, if it turns out to be just the opposite, it’s still okay because <strong>one’s strength can help make up for the other’s weakness.</strong></p>
                <h4>Final Screens</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/FDC_final_screens.jpg" alt="final screens">
                <h4>Impact</h4>
                <p>The societal impact I would like to make on couples in LDR is that there’s <strong>no need to be afraid of the distance between them</strong> and their special ones and <strong>it’s okay to run out of things to share</strong> during video-chat. LDR couples are no different from ordinary couples. Though reminiscing the good old days helps them go through the dark lonely nights, <strong>couples can still create new memories in spite of being physically apart.</strong> </p>
                <p> Through my design, I want to <strong>inspire more potential or future design for LDR couples</strong> as during my competitive analysis, I found that there’s less existing digital solutions designed just for LDR couples. </p>
                <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                <p>The hardest part of going through the design process is not design itself. Instead, for me, it’s <strong>conquering the fear of falling behind.</strong> I’m really fortunate to have Tonya as my instructor to boost me up when I felt that I could not see my strength in the field of information with an economics background. However, as it turned out, my past-4-year <strong>training in economics does help me think more thoroughly and go one step forward to consider the long-run effect of my product.</strong></p>
