                <h4>The Vision</h4>
                <h3>Consistency across platforms</h3>
                <p>Walmart’s mission of “Save money. Live better.” has made it one of the most popular and largest retail cooperation in the United States. As the new Walmart.com introduced a more personal and relatable experience for desktop shoppers, improving the current Walmart app is imperative to the consistency in experience.</p>
                <!-- <p>Growing up on a small island, Taiwan, I’ve never had my own room before I came to the States to pursue my Master’s degree. I still remember how excited I was when I got to decide how I’d like to style my room and beddings and thus went on countless shopping trips for them. My story sparked the ideas for my redesign of the Houzz mobile app, a one-stop platform for preview and purchase of furniture and home decorations.</p>

                <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
                <h3>Design for 2 opportunities -- review and compare</h3>
                <p>My personal experience of shopping online sparks the ideas for 2 opportunities for the Walmart app redesign – 1) Relatable reviews and 2) Product comparison.</p>
                <p>As a frequent online shopper, I rely heavily on customer reviews as it provides more information that I can relate to in addition to being a more objective source of opinion. Additionally, since I shop on a budget, I spend a lot of time shopping around before I check out. However, current Walmart app isn’t optimized for a careful shopper like me as text reviews takes more time to read and the products recommended only add to the number of items in my cart but doesn’t help with decision-making.</p>
                <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
                <h3>Create relatable and personalized experience</h3>
                <p>The goal of the redesign aims to 1) create more relatable and personalized experience, 2) increase the sense of community and 3) decrease churn-outs during the decision-making process for Walmart app users.</p>

                <h6>Screens of Walmart app redesign</h6>
                <h4>Opportunity 1: Relatable Reviews</h4>
                <h3>Include image and body information</h3>
                <!-- <p>As a first-time user, I decided to try out Houzz myself and imagined going on a pillow shopping-spree. To get to know more about how Houzz 3D preview can benefit my pillow shopping experience, I started by searching for pillows on Houzz and specifically looked for pillows with 3D preview.</p> -->
                <h5>Recommendation</h5>
                <p>For products like apparel and shoes, images or size charts provided by the sellers don’t always answer inquiries shoppers of varying shapes and sizes might have. Including images provides a direct reflection of customer's opinion. Asking reviewers for standardized information such as weight, height and size can set as references for other customers when making purchasing decisions.</p>

                    </div>
                </div> -->
                <h5>Business Implication: Customer Loyalty</h5>
                <p>Asking standardized questions lowers the barrier for providing insightful reviews compared to the number of stars with plain text. Also, mobile devices have made sharing so easy and common that people take pictures of what they like and even tag sellers in their posts to make their voices heard. Allowing customers to post images in their reviews can share Walmart’s burden of showing and guessing the details that customers are interested in and create a more relatable experience.</p>
                <p>In the long run, as the quality of customer reviews increases. Walmart shoppers feel encouraged to share their views, may it be good or bad. This way, it builds a sense of trusted community across Walmart shoppers, which would further strengthen customer’s loyalty for Walmart.</p>
                <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/houzz/houzz_import_flow.jpg" alt="original import flow">
                <h6>Original save &amp; import flow</h6> -->
                <br>
                <h5>Validation</h5>
                <p>Before Walmart rolls out the change to reviews across all platforms and products, I’d recommend conducting a pilot in one of the departments where a high percentage of customers leave their reviews to make sure that Walmart customers feel comfortable sharing their personal information such as weight and height for products like clothing.</p>
                <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/houzz/houzz_compare_flow.jpg" alt="original compare">
                <h6>Original 3D preview isn't optimized for comparison apart from appearance and price</h6> -->
                <br>
                <h5>Success Metrics</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increase in numbers of informative reviews:</strong> While the number of reviews without text input remains, more customers are willing to share their size information to help other shoppers make informed shopping decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Control over privacy:</strong> Walmart customers are aware that it’s not mandatory for them to share size information in their reviews</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Walmart app users have no problem adding images to their review from their mobile devices</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Opportunity 2: Personalized Comparison</h4>
                <h3>Summarize similar products in a table for better comparison</h3>
                <!-- <p>To avoid potential user pains that stems from the design changes, I follow most of the user flow that the Houzz app currently has.</p> -->
                <h5>Recommendation</h5>
                <p>To help speed up the decision-making process, Walmart app should summarize similar products customer has meaningful interactions with in a table for better comparison.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>The reason why I didn’t go with the first 2 options is that clicking on the info button for the purpose of color-picking is less intuitive than simply showing it to the users.</p> -->
                <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/houzz/houzz_color_redesign.jpg" alt="color pick">

                <br>
                <h5>How to define meaningful interactions?</h5>
                <p><a rhef="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/16/walmart-coms-big-redesign-will-roll-out-in-may/">Walmart algorithms</a> are able to differentiate between gifts for friends and family or other one-time purchases, versus things users regularly search for, desire and buy. Based on information collected from each Walmart app user, we can identify what app users usually do to compare between products. Here, I assume most customers add all the items that they’re interested in to the cart and filter out what to buy before they check out because current Walmart app makes it easy to add an item to cart but not for saving an item to list.</p>
                <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/houzz/houzz_import_redesign.jpg" alt="save and import">
                <h6>By streamlining Save-to-ideabook flow (left) and the Import-to-3D-preview flow (right), the interaction becomes more intuitive.</h6> -->
                <br>
                <h5>Business Implication: Decrease Choice Overload</h5>
                <p>Being a hypermarket, Walmart offers a wide range of products. Moreover, a single product can come in various brands and sizes. While the variety attracts a wide customer base, according to behavioral economics <a href="https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/choice-overload/">theories</a>, it doesn’t lead to a higher number of final purchase due to <i>decision fatigue</i> – A lot of them end up never checked out. However, choice overload can be counteracted by simplifying choice attributes or the number of available options. Hence, including a compare feature based on what was placed in the list or cart would help make customers make more informed decisions.</p>
                <p>In the long run, if less customers shop on impulse, there would be less returns and helpful for relieving labor spent on restock.</p>
                <!-- <img src="img/portfolio/houzz/houzz_compare_redesign.jpg" alt="compare">
                <h6>Comparison-enabled 3D preview can help with decision-making</h6> -->
                <h5>Validation</h5>
                <p>While behavioral economics theories shed light on the direction for the redesign, it has not been experimented in an e-commerce settings. In addition, some studies on customer products suggest that greater choice should be offered in product domains in which people tend to feel ignorant (e.g. wine), whereas less choice should be provided in domains in which people tend to feel knowledgeable (e.g. soft drinks). Hence, it would be a good idea to conduct an A/B test in different prodcut categories to figure out if the choice overlaod have an impact on Walmart customers' purchase behavior.</p>
                <h5>Success Metrics</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increase in checkout:</strong> Walmart app users respond to the “Add to Cart” CTA in the comparison chart and finish checkout</li>
                    <li><strong>Less returns:</strong> Customers who completes their purchase with the help of the comparison chart feel confident about their purchase decision and do not return what they buy</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h4>
                <p>This is not my first time redesigning a mobile shopping app. However, I’d say this is one of the most challenging exercise because Walmart sells almost everything. Interactions that work on specialized seller apps such as Ikea don’t necessarily suit Walmart. Nonetheless, the ultimate goal of providing better shopping experience is the same. As Walmart continues to create more relatable experience through its marketing campaign on Walmart.com, I believe it’s worth experiments to add some personal touch to the mobile app as well.</p>
                <h5 style="padding-top:0.5em;">If Sky’s the Limit</h5>
                <p>With the use of AR technology, customers can try on clothes or compare between different products by preview them in 3D via their phone. This way, the mobile shopping experience feels more real – Customers can really compare what they want to buy side by side, just like what they do in the store.</p>
                <!-- <h5 style="padding-top:0.5em;">A/B Test</h5>
                <p>I also played around with one screen that involves discount pricing and took advantage of the target users' price-conciousness, which I think is worth A/B-testing to see if the left-digit bias theory serves well in reality.</p>
                <p>What sparked the idea is that as a price-sensitive homeowner, I'd like to know if there's a price increase when I select a different color. This use case exists not only in products sold on Houzz but also on Amazon. Likewise, if there's a price decrease, emphasizing on the savings would increase my willingness to purchase the item.</p>
