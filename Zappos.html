                <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
                <h3>Design hybrid platforms for Zappos Coworking</h3>
                <p>As part of the interview for the UX Designer at Zappos, I was challenged to design hybrid platforms for 1) public-facing website and 2) internal management system that allows Zappos Co-working to serve information, make reservation, deal with payments and assets.</p>
                <p>I was presented with the following assumptions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pricing will be a flat daily rate with some pre-pay and group discounts</li>
                    <li>Amenities available on Zappos campus (like snacks, cereal, drinks, etc.) are included for co-workers</li>
                    <li>Power and Wi-Fi are included</li>
                </ol>

                <h6>Zappos wants to open up some parts of its HQ as coworking spaces</h6>
                <!-- <h4>Why Educate Users?</h4>
                <h5>Assumption: Users go with defaults</h3>
                <p>Users like to go with the default option. Namely, they join their friend’s family plans for unlimited data, calls and text due to limited time to search. Also, they always go with the latest model because they’re tech-savvy but have a hard time understanding technical terms. Hence, they’re most likely spending more money than they should have or on products that don’t fit their needs. In the meanwhile, they are trying to save money.</p>
                <p>In short, while both users are interested in new technology, they aren’t aware of their real needs nor alternative options because of the time it takes to research.</p>

                <h6>It's easy for users to forget about their needs and go with the easy option when things get complicated.</h6> -->
                <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
                <h3>Focus on MVP</h3>
                <p>Zappos Co-working does not have infrastructure to manage its offerings. Namely, both platforms need to be built from scratch in a week. Hence, defining the MVPs is of great importance. The hybrid platforms focus on the the following features: 1) Serve information of different cowork spaces, 2) Make reservations on desktop and on-the-go, 3) Manage reservations, and 4) Decrease firction in space management.</p>

                <h6>Screens of the Zappos Coworking</h6>
                <h4>User Journey</h4>
                <p>I defined the following features based on user journeys under an assumed user journey.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Zappos/Zappos_user_journey.png" alt="user journey">
                <h6>Explaining technical terms helps users not only save time but also feel more confident about the recommendation result.</h6>
                <h4>Persona</h4>
                <p>Users that would most benefited from the public-facing platform have the following characteristics:</p>
                <h5>Small Business Owner</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Limited time to search:</strong> One-person team overwhelmed by the amount of work every day</li>
                    <li><strong>Need to stay focused:</strong> Get easily distracted and fail to maintain work-life balance when working at home</li>
                    <li><strong>Small network:</strong> Look for partners to work with to expand business</li>
                </ol>
                <h5>Hacker Team</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Growing team:</strong> Need a larger place for work and meetings</li>
                    <li><strong>Increasing needs for guest-meetings:</strong> Most co-working space doesn’t allow guests</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Managers of the Zappos Co-working space that would most benefited from the management platform have the following characteristics:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Limited labor to manage the space: </strong> There’s no designated managers for the coworking space. The current managers are the receptionists</li>
                    <li><strong>Not familiar with all spaces:</strong> The Zappos campus is so big that it’s hard to have full understanding of the space usage and asset condition</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>User Needs</h4>
                <p>To understand the challenges that co-working space users and managers can be faced with in a broader sense, I looked into online discussions on co-workers’ reviews and potential competitors’ website to figure out current user pain points and management limitations.</p>
                <h5>Pain Point 1: No guests allowed</h5>
                <p>Longer lease is better for the use of space from the landlord’s point of view, in this case, Zappos Coworking. The same case stands for startup teams / small business owners. However, for startup teams / small businesses to expand, the coworking space needs to function like a normal office that not only serves as a place that they can get work done but help them grow – a big part of growth comes from investment and partnership. However, traditional coworking spaces doesn’t allow personal guests, who can be potential investors, stakeholders and so on.</p>
                <h5>Pain Point 2: Chairs / Furniture got moved around</h5>
                <p>Managing a coworking space can be hard –- coworker visits fluctuate and furniture gets moved around very often. To avoid desks without chairs, co-work space managers spend a lot of time matching chairs and desks.</p>
                
                <h4>Public-Facing Platform</h4>
                <p>Knowing that the cost of time and effort is the reason for going with defaults, the question would be “How might we make search a less painful experience?” and “How might we raise awareness for a change?”.</p>
                <h5>Scenario 1</h5>
                <h3>Serve Information</h3>
                <p>The Zappos Coworking site serves as the primary platform for space related information while the app serves to show coworkers about their reservation details or for search, browse and reserve on-the-go.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Zappos/zappos_scene_01.jpg" alt="Serve Information">
                <h6>Assumption: Coworkers are most likely to learn about the coworking space via the site before they go ahead to download the app</h6>
                <br>
                <h5>Scenario 2</h5>
                <h3>Make reservation &amp; payment</h3>
                <p>After the coworker has decided on a space to reserve, he can either reserve the space or book a visit. For designated desk, the coworker would be asked to choose a seat he likes before proceeding to payment. Under payment, he can opt to prepay in full to enjoy a discount or pay in installment.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Zappos/zappos_scene_02_01.jpg" alt="Desktop booking">
                <h6>Booking and payment flow on the website</h6>
                <br>
                <p>For booking on an app, I assume that the coworker is booking a temporary seat on-the-go. She has previous experience of using the Zappos Coworking service, so it would save her some time during the checkout. However, if she didn't link her card information to her account, the app will direct her to do so. After the spot is reserved, the page will show her date and seat information.</p>

                <h6>Booking and payment flow on the app</h6>
                <br>
                <h5>Scenario 3</h5>
                <h3>Check in</h3>
                <p>Jenny can check in at the City Hall reception desk using the unique QR code in her profile page. As she scans her profile, the cowork space manager would be able to match Jenny's face with her reservation details in the system.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Sprint/sol_02.jpg" alt="Give relatable examples">
                <h6>Explaining technical terms helps users not only save time but also feel more confident about the recommendation result.</h6>
                <h4>What If?</h4>
                <h5>Edge Case</h5>
                <h3>Customer isn’t so sure about the recommendation.</h3>
                <p>Users are always making tradeoffs between price and features. Also, they tend to be more cautious when shopping for expensive items online. Hence, it's most likely that users don't check out as soon as they arrive at the recommendation page.</p>
                <h5>Solution 1: Easy access to product page</h5>
                <p>Apart from color/size selection, providing easy access to the product page makes users feel knowledgeable about the recommendation associated to their choice. In addition, by including a quick switch between product page and checkout, I hope to increase the conversion rate from the quiz result.</p>
                <h5>Solution 2: Include popular alternatives</h5>
                <p>Since the questions included in the quiz only focus on the feature-level, the recommendation doesn’t necessarily fit into user’s budget constraint. Hence, in the recommendation page, we also include popular alternatives aka cheaper/more expensive options to satisfy users of various purchasing power.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/Sprint/edge_case.jpg" alt="Give relatable examples">
                <h6>Screen of the final recommendation page</h6>
                <!-- <h5>Validation</h5>
                <p>While behavioral economics theories shed light on the direction for the redesign, it has not been experimented in an e-commerce settings. In addition, some studies on customer products suggest that greater choice should be offered in product domains in which people tend to feel ignorant (e.g. wine), whereas less choice should be provided in domains in which people tend to feel knowledgeable (e.g. soft drinks). Hence, it would be a good idea to conduct an A/B test in different prodcut categories to figure out if the choice overlaod have an impact on Walmart customers' purchase behavior.</p>
                <h5>Success Metrics</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Increase in checkout:</strong> Walmart app users respond to the “Add to Cart” CTA in the comparison chart and finish checkout</li>
                    <li><strong>Less returns:</strong> Customers who completes their purchase with the help of the comparison chart feel confident about their purchase decision and do not return what they buy</li>
                </ul> -->
                <h4>Takeaways &amp; Next Steps</h4>
                <h5>Implementation</h5>
                <p>If the quiz is going to be implemented on Sprint's website, I'd recommend complementing the quiz with marketing CTA such as "Take a quiz to find your perfect phone" or "Are you paying more than you should?" to remind or raise user's awareness of money-saving. Moreover, before shipping the design, I have to make sure not only the usability of the UI itself but also be mindful of the target customers. In the CTA mentioned above, I'm targeting non-Sprint users, hoping to convert them to Sprint users. However, if the quiz only attracts current Sprint users and they find out that they're actually don't need unlimited plan which they'r currently on, it might take a toll on the business.</p>
                <h5>Reflection</h5>
                <p>To be honest, before I got my hands dirty on the design challenge, I thought it's just another "search" problem. However, it turned out more complicated than I'd expected as there are a lot of use cases to take into account when I was walking through the whole phone-purchasing journey. In addition, it's more than just a problem that feels like part of my everyday life or have experience with -- It also involves explaining technical terms, winning trust of the users and the impact it has on the business itself. Despite the complexity, I enjoy the design challenge a lot -- I got to have a taste of how my future work looks like and now I start to feel excited about what I'm going to work on in the future.</p>
                <!-- <h5 style="padding-top:0.5em;">A/B Test</h5>
                <p>I also played around with one screen that involves discount pricing and took advantage of the target users' price-conciousness, which I think is worth A/B-testing to see if the left-digit bias theory serves well in reality.</p>
                <p>What sparked the idea is that as a price-sensitive homeowner, I'd like to know if there's a price increase when I select a different color. This use case exists not only in products sold on Houzz but also on Amazon. Likewise, if there's a price decrease, emphasizing on the savings would increase my willingness to purchase the item.</p>
