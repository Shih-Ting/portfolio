                <p>In a team of 4, we competed in the CHI 2018 Student Design Competition, whose theme this year is "ENGAGE", use human-centred design approaches to develop a new way to support, <i>empower, or change the behaviour of a group around a shared area of interest.</i> Our team decided to focus on the psychological welfare of injured student athletes since after initial survey, 96.5% of injured student athletes reported affected their psychological well-being.</p> -->
                <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
                <h3>Engage and Empower Injured Student Athletes</h3>
                <!-- <div class="resp-container">
                    <iframe class="resp-iframe" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TnfHPfqx_uw" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div> -->
                <p>Student-athlete life centers around team and competition. Playing sports isn't just about competing in games but it also represents a student-athlete's identity and has to do with their social lives. However, things can go wrong once they got injured -- physical injured can lead to psychological issues. Worse yet, according to the Mind, Body, and Sport handbook by NCAA, only 63% of the student-athletes indicated a willingness to ask for help from health services if they have mental health concerns.</p>

                <h4>Solution Overview</h4>
                <h3>Rehab Competition &amp; Social Support</h3>
                <p>To conquer the design challenge, we, in a team of 4, proposed AthleteJuvo, a gamification rehab app that incorporates team competition through rehabilitation exercise, social supports and visualized progress. This way, we hope to help injured student athletes regain their self identity through competition in the short run and overcome psychological as well as physical issues in the long run.</p>

                <h4>Research</h4>
                <h5>Literature Review</h5>
                <p>We started off our research process with literature reviews and identified 3 major findings that shed light our later survey, interview and design directions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Injury causes a great deal of stress to injured athletes.</li>
                    <li>Social support plays a key role in an athlete's rehabilitation process.</li>
                    <li>There are distinct social support needs associated with different phases of the rehabilitation.</li>
                </ol>
                <!-- <h5>Persona</h5>
                <p>Based on the research findings, we summarize target users with have the following qualities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Athletes in the initial injury stage that need information from athletes who have similar experience.</li>
                    <li>Athletes who are experiencing depression in the stagnant stage of rehabilitation with the need of motivation, and the sense of achievement and competition.</li>
                </ul> -->
                <h5>Survey &amp; Interview</h5>
                <p>Then, to understand the problems injured athletes encountered in a broader sense, we conducted an online survey and held eight semi-structured interviews, including 2 expert interviews and 6 injured athlete interviews.</p>
                <!-- <p>Then, to understand the problems injured athletes encountered in a broader sense, we conducted an online survey where the access was limited to injured athletes. To get an in-depth understanding of the rehabilitation experience of injured athletes, we held eight semi-structured interviews in this initial stage, including 2 expert interviews and 6 user interviews.</p> -->
                <h4>Insight-Driven Design</h4>
                <h5>Insight 1</h5>
                <h3>Rehab exercise is repetitive and can't satisfy athletes' competitive nature.</h3>
                <p>Athletes gain sense of achievement by taking part in games. Not being able to participate in routine practice and competition lead to the loss of identity in an athlete.</p>
                <h5>First Attempt: Competition-Centered Rehab</h5>
                <p>While we cannot change the repetitive nature of rehab exercise, we came up with a gamification solution to create a competition between injured athletes. The following is a low-fi prototype that focuses on showing the performance of the rehab progress and the competition. However, during our first user test, even though users are happy with the design concept, none of them were able to tell how to start the rehab exercise.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/AthleteJuvo/old_rehab.png" alt="Old Rehab">
                <h6>Competition-Centered Rehab</h6>
                <h5>Second Attempt: Rehab-Centered Competition</h5>
                <p>We realized that this is an affordance issue -- our rehab solution isn't rehab-friendly. Hence, we quickly went onto iterate on the design, aiming to strike a balance between rehab and competition by highlighting individual rehab progress and rehab assigned by physical therapists.</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/AthleteJuvo/new_rehab.png" alt="New Rehab">
                <h6>Rehab-Centered Competition</h6>
                <h5>Diving Deeper: Detection</h5>
                <p>To make sure the rehab game is fair, it then came to us that we need accurate movement detection that can record and sync with AthleteJuvo. Based on our interview findings, physical therapists only provide paper-based tracking sheets for rehab tracking and there's no way for physical therapist to know whether a patient is doing their rehab or not if they don't visit the hospital routinely.</p>
                <!--  <h5>Survey</h5>
                <p> An online questionnarie was distributed to sport-related clubs and associations through email lists at the University of Michigan. A total of 87 athletes with injury experience completed the online survey during a 9-day period. Major findings include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>96.5% of the injured athletes indicated the injury affected their psychological well-being</li>
                    <li>92% of the injured athletes reported suffering from depression and isolation during their rehabilitation</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Expert Interview</h5>
                <p>One physical therapist at the University of Michigan, and one mental coach from the Facebook group, The Injured Athletes Club, were interviewd at this stage. Key findings includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students are too busy to do their rehab routinely if they are away from the team.</li>
                    <li>Most injured student-athletes find it difficult to let people understand their situation.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="img/portfolio/athletejuvo_uhs.jpg" alt="UHS">
                <h5>Injured Student Athlete Interview</h5>
                <p>We interviewed 6 volunteer athletes who were in the rehabilitation process or recently recovered from their injuries and concluded with the following findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An athlete's daily schedule is usually team-centered and and their social network bonds with the team.</li>
                    <li>The loss of identity and sense of isolation is due to the fact that they cannot compete in games or participate in trainings.</li>
                    <li>Injured student-athletes all tried to seek help from friends who had similar experiences to get emotional support.</li>
                    <li>Keeping track of the rehabilitation progress is difficult, since physical therapists only provide paper-based tracking sheets.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="img/portfolio/athletejuvo_interview.jpg" alt="Interview"> -->
                <h5>Technology Analysis</h5>
                <!--img slide: devices-->
                <p>To save athletes the hassle of tracking and bridge the information gap between patients and physical therapist, we looked into current technologies available for motion tracking. We evaluate the 3 technologies based on 3 criteria:
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li><strong>Smart bands:</strong> Athletes can wear around their head or limbs to detect heart rate and motions</li>
                        <li><strong>Kinect:</strong> While athletes are in rehab center or at home, Kinect can help them detect the correctness of their gestures more accurately</li>
                        <li><strong>Wearable sensing fabric:</strong> Combined with the use of a motion detector chip, the extension of elastic fabric allows for detection of various motion degrees and more body parts at the same time.</li>
                    </ul> -->
                    <img src="img/portfolio/AthleteJuvo/athletejuvo_comparative.jpg" alt="Tech Compare">
                    <p>As it turned out, while all 3 solutions could work in terms of recording body movement data, <strong>only wearable sening fabric could be carried around easily and attached to different parts of the body, allowing for more accurate senor.</strong> Therefore, we decided to incorporate wearable sensing fabric as our movement recording solution.</p>
                    <!-- <p>The technology of sensing fabrics has been widely discussed in chemical engineering and information technology fields due to their versatility. It has been implemented in cardiovascular disease sensors, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) sensors, and even respiration or temperature sensors. Wearable sensing fabric is suitable for injured athletes for its high flexibility which <strong>allows it to attach on any injured parts and accurately measure strain, rotation, and
                  flexion movements commonly found in rehabilitation exercises.</strong></p> -->
                    <!--                  <h4>Idea Generation</h4>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/brainstorm.JPG" alt="Ideation">
                    <p>From the initial user research, personas, and technology analysis, we concluded our <strong>key design directions</strong>: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bond injured athletes with their non-injured teammates more closely, and make both parties participate in the same activities to provide injured athletes a sense of contribution and competition as a team.</li>
                        <li>Use wearable sensing fabric as a means of recording athletes’ rehabilitation progress.</li>
                        <li>Connect injured athletes together while providing ways for them to find companionship and fun.</li>
                    </ul> -->
                    <h5>Insight 2</h5>
                    <h3>Stress stems from disconnection from the team and not knowing current status of recovery.</h3>
                    <p>An athlete's daily schedule is usually team-centered and and their social network bonds with the team. Being injured forced them out of their original social circle. In additon, if injury takes longer to cure, athletes feels anxious because they are not sure if rehab is helping at all.</p>
                    <h5>Solution 1: Visualize the Progress</h5>
                    <p>Using wearable sensing fabric, student-athletes are able to track their completion and progress of rehab exercises without hassles.</p>
                    <img src="img/portfolio/AthleteJuvo/track.png" alt="track">
                    <h6>Rehab instructions and Progress Tracking</h6>
                    <h5>Solution 2: Rebuild Connections</h5>
                    <p>Perseverance and encouragement is an integral part of the rehab journey before recovery. Injured athletes can contribute to the team by not only finishing rehab exercise every day but also asking non-injured team mates to support them by sending out challenges, which opens a door for further coversations.</p>

                    <h6>Send out challenges to non-injured teammates</h6>

                    <h3>It's hard for injured atheltes to find someone who shares similar experinece.</h3>
                    <h5>Solution: Meet Injured Athletes Nearby</h5>
                    <p>AthleteJuvo allows injured student-athletes to message nearby athletes to meet and chat about their experience or finish their rehabilitation sessions together.</p>

                    <!-- In the initial user interviews, athletes reported that one of the stress points they suffered during the injury period was the unawareness of their rehabilitation progress. Therefore, creating visualized data and keeping them informed
                  is a crucial part of the rehabilitation process. -->
                    <!-- <strong>Detection: </strong>Our team decided to utilize sensing fabric to detect and record rehabilitation data. The rehabilitation tasks are assigned by their physical therapists. Also, the sensing fabric patch detects the amount the fabric has stretched. Once the fabric is worn over moving joints or injured muscles, the repetitions can be easily counted to allow the user to keep track of their progress.</p> -->
                    <!-- <h5>Rehabilitation</h5>
                        <p>The Rehab tab, which includes exercises assigned by physical therapists and real-time ranking within the team and against the rival team, is the default screen that athletes land on when they open the app. The design aims to incentivize athletes to engage in rehab on a frequent basis.</p>

                        <h5>Achievements</h5>
                        <p>Perseverance and encouragement is an integral part of the rehab journey before recovery. Injured athletes can contribute to the team by not only finishing rehab exercise every day but also asking non-injured team mates to support them by sending out challenges, which opens a door for further communications.</p>

                        <h5>Track</h5>
                        <p>Using wearable sensing fabric, student-athletes are able to track their completion and progress of rehab exercises without hassles.</p>

                        <h5>Near Me</h5>
                        <p>Since rehabilitation exercises are usually repetitive tasks, athletes often find it boring later on. Therefore, AthleteJuvo allows injured student-athletes to message nearby athletes to meet and chat or finish their rehabilitation sessions together.</p>

                        <p>We went through 2 iterations to test our design solutions, using low and high-fidelity prototypes respecitvely. The participants were asked to perform the first 2 tasks during low-fidelity testing and all tasks during high-fidelity testing:</p> -->
                    <!-- , with our team members  -->
                    <!-- <ul>
                            <li>Attaching the sensing fabric on any of their joints or muscles, and starting the rehabilitation exercise.</li>
                            <li>Checking their daily rehabilitation progress and team scores.</li>
                            <li>Checking nearby injured athletes and inviting them to do rehabilitation exercises together.</li>

                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li>Like the idea of AthleteJuvo as the gaming solution does provide a sense of competition</li>
                        <li>Wish to get a greater sense of engagement by having features such as taunting their rival schools</li>
                        <li>Wish to see their monthly or long-term progress besides daily progress</li>
                        <li>Wish to know the sports the other injured athletes play</li>
                    </ul> -->
                    <!-- <p>Based on the feedback, we decided to add a <strong>calendar</strong> and more statistics visualization to show the progress, and add a feature that allows athletes to <strong>taunt rival teams and cheer for those in the same school.</strong> When other injured athletes are nearby, the application shows the sports they play.</p> -->

                            <li>Users like the intuitive design, simple but energetic vibe of the interface, mentioning that it makes the rehabilitation exercises more fun.</li>
                            <!-- <li>Some users were confused about the scoring system.</li> -->
                            <li>Some of them did not know that they could get extra points by sending challenges to their non-injured teammates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The users’ feedback confirmed that it would be better to have a clear guide or tutorials for the features.</p>
                        <h4>Overall Feedback</h4>
                        <h5>User</h5>
                        <p>I think it (AthleteJuvo) is cool because a lot of athletes struggle emotionally. When you get injuries, you are out of sport, and sport is your identity. So I think it is gaining it back and making it competitive through rehab, I like this a lot.</p>
                        <h5>External Judge @CHI</h5>
                        <p>In general, the work is well motivated and the process is well documented. The submission should possibly be accepted.</p>
                        <h5>Internal Judge @CHI</h5>
                        <p>The design research is process is systematic and sufficient, by involving the target user groups, as well as the therapists. The app design is well-crafted.</p>
                        <h4>Takeaways and Reflection</h4>
                        <p>Looking back, I think my team is trying to solve a lot of problems with AthleteJuvo and thus creates a fun but also complicated rehab gaming mechanism. If I were to start all over again, I would pay more attention to prioritizing the real needs of injuried student-athletes and delving into the requirements of therapuetic goals.</p>
